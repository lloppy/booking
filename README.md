### Description

**Booking** is a service for the self-employed (hairdressers, tutors, etc.), who take clients at home, enabling them to schedule appointments and manage these appointments efficiently.

Take a hairdresser, for example. A specialist keeps track of client appointments in a paper diary. After each haircut or by phone, through messengers, clients can schedule their next visit to the master. In this scenario, the client must remember their schedule; there is a risk that the client will forget the appointment and not show up. Also, if the master needs to cancel appointments, they have to call or send messages to everyone and rearrange.
The goal is to automate the appointment booking process with a web service integrated with Google Calendar, mailing services, and Telegram, easing the master's management of appointments for their services.


### Features

- Client booking using QR code
- Master's account with a description of services on a personal page.
- Management of the schedule and appointments. Clients can book a service directly on the page with the event displayed in Google Calendar.
- The ability for clients to cancel or reschedule an appointment directly in their Google Calendar.
- Confirmation of the appointment by email, in Telegram; reminders one day and two hours before the appointment.
- The ability for the master to cancel all appointments for specific days. Notifications to clients to reschedule at a different time.
- Additional waiting list feature: clients can join a waiting list if their preferred time is taken. If an earlier booked client cancels their appointment, the waiting list client will be notified that the time has become available and can confirm or decline their booking.
